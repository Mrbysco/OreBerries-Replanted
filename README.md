# Oreberries Replanted #

## About ##
Are you tired of your ores generating in rock? Do you want to grow your ore? Well, you no longer have to hope! Now you can grow ores in the form of berries.

## Disclaimer ##
This mod is inspired by the [SlimeKnights](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/) mod berries ([Tcon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)/[natura](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natura)).

This mod does not use any textures from Tinkers Construct, all textures have been provided by the wonderful [Ridanisaurus](https://www.curseforge.com/members/ridanisaurus/followers).
